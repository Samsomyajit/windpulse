### 🎯 Problem Statement

Wind farms require regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance and longevity. However, scheduling maintenance during high wind power periods results in significant energy production losses. WindPulse addresses this challenge by:

<div class="feature-card">
  
1. **Analyzing historical and real-time wind power density data** - Process years of wind data to identify patterns
2. **Identifying consistent low-power periods** - Find optimal maintenance windows across diurnal cycles
3. **Clustering wind farms with similar patterns** - Group sites for coordinated maintenance
4. **Recommending optimal maintenance windows** - Minimize production impact with data-driven scheduling
